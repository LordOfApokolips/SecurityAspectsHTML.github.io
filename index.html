            <h3><u>Malware</u></h3>
            <p1>Malware is a piece of software designed to damage and/or control computer systems. Malware is a short term for malicious software. Malware is an inclusive term for all types of malicious software. Some examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Adware - While some forms of adware may be considered legitimate, others make unauthorised access to computer systems and greatly disrupt users</li>
                    <li>Botnets – Short for “robot network,” these are networks of infected computers under the control of a single attacking partie using command-and-control servers. Botnets are highly versatile and adaptable.</li>
                    <li>Ransomware – Is a criminal business model that uses malicious software to hold valuable files, data or information for ransom. Victims of a ransomware attack may have their operations severely degraded or shut down entirely.</li>
                    <li>Spyware – Malware that collects information about the usage of the infected computer and communicates it back to the attacker. The term includes botnets, adware, backdoor behavior, key-loggers, data theft and net-worms.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3><u>Viruses and Hacking</u></h3>
                <p2>A computer virus is a certain type of program for computers and requires the users input to build upon itself and affect anything. This replication of itself happens by changing other computer programs and inserting itself as code in the device's main code.<br><strong>The primary difference between a virus and a worm is that viruses must be triggered by the activation of their host; whereas worms are stand-alone malicious programs that can self-replicate and propagate independently as soon as they have breached the system.</strong><br><br></p2>
                    </ul>

            <h4><u>Hacking</u></h4>
                <p3>Hacking is the process by which someone is trying to gain unauthorised access to a computer system or network. 

                <br><strong>There are two types of hackers:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Black hat hackers - Black hat hackers are people who access systems illegally with mailcious intent and is often for personal gain.</li>
                    <br><li>White hat hackers - White hat hackers are people who work with people and/or companies to help identify and find out about weaknesses in their systems and make updates to help make it better. They do this to ensure that black hat hackers cannot access the system's data illegally.</li>
                </ul>   
                    <br>
                </ul></p3>
                <h3>Protection against Malware and Viruses</h3>
                <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"><strong> There are many ways to be protected from these types of software. The main ways include:</strong>
                <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">Firewalls - Firewalls can be both software and hardware. Firewalls are packet filters, stateful inspection and proxy server firewalls.
                    <br><br>Packet Filter Firewall - A packet filter firewall is one of the most simple firewalls. It applies its rules (A packet filter which is present in the firewall will check the source and destination IP address of the packet being sent. This is one of the many things it does to ensure safety of the receiving side.) to each packet and the allows or disallows that packet from the network.
                    <br><br>Stateful Inspection - Stateful inspection, also known as dynamic packet filtering, collects data from every connection made. It keeps a list of all safe connections. When another connection is attempted, it will check the qualities to see if it is safe connection. It can inspect packets to see if they contain malicious code.
                    <br><br>>Proxy server firewall - A proxy server is a gate between you and the internet. A good proxy server can keep the users on the network safe by filtering out unsafe content. It can help maintain your privacy because the proxy server will have a different IP address from you.
                <br><br>Anti Virus Software - Anti virus software is specifically designed to help detect, protect and remove and malicious software or viruses. Once it has been installed, most antivirus software run automatically in the background to provide real-time protection against virus attacks.</ul></p>
            
            <br><h5><u>DOS, DODS, Ransomware and CAPTCHA</u></h5>
            <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"><strong> DoS - This stands for the : Denial of Service. The main ways include:</strong>
                <br><strong>DDoS - This stands for the : Distributed Denial of Service.</strong></p>
                
            <p><br>Both of these services attack and/or flood a server with requests that disrupt its service caused by the volume of traffic. An example of DDoS is : Amazon Web Services which was attacked in February of 2020. AWS said the February attack had fired 2.3Tbps.
                    </ul>

            <u><h6>Ransomeware</u></h6>
            <p><u>An example of a ransomeware attack would be the WannaCry:</u>
                <p>The Ransomware attack happened in May 2017.
                <br>It used EternalBlue a cyber attack exploit developed by the US National Security Agency.
                <br>This exploit was taken by the Shadow Brokers who sold and distributed it along with other exploits.
                <br>Estimated to have infected 200,000 computers in 150 countries.
                <br>Researcher Marcus Hutchins discovered a killswitch and stopped the virus by registering a domain name.

                <h6><u>CAPTCHA</u></h6>
                <p>Many sites nowadays require something called CAPTCHA.
                
                CAPTCHA stands for the following: **Completely Automated Public Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart** These tests are called Turing tests. 
                <br><u>What is the use for these tests?</u>
                
                <strong><br>Turing test was originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950 and was/is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent le tto be abo, or indistinguishable from, a human.</strong></p5></ul></p>
